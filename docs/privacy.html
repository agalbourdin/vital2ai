            <h1>Vital2AI - Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Vital2AI is built with privacy as a core principle. Your health data is among your most sensitive
                information, and we ensure it remains entirely under your control.</p>

            <h2>1. Local Processing & Sandboxed Security</h2>
            <p>All health data is read directly from HealthKit and processed entirely on your device. The app operates
                in a sandboxed environment, meaning it has no access to your other files or data beyond what you
                explicitly grant. We do not use any external servers to process, analyze, or interpret your health
                information.</p>

            <h2>2. Ephemeral Files & Automatic Cleanup</h2>
            <p>The CSV files generated for export are stored in a temporary, secure directory on your device. To ensure
                maximum security, these files are strictly ephemeral:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immediate Deletion:</strong> All exported files are automatically deleted the moment you
                    navigate away from the success screen or if the app is moved to the background.</li>
                <li><strong>No Residual Data:</strong> No copy of your health data is permanently stored within the
                    app's local storage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Biometric & Device Security</h2>
            <p>We use industry-standard Local Authentication (FaceID, TouchID, or your device Passcode) to gate the
                export process. This ensures that even if your device is unlocked, your health data can only be exported
                by you.</p>

            <h2>4. Zero Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit your health data—or any analytics about your usage—to any third
                parties. The CSV files are generated locally and are only shared with the destinations you explicitly
                choose via the iOS Share Sheet.</p>

            <h2>5. HealthKit Access & Control</h2>
            <p>The app requests read-only access to specific HealthKit types necessary for the export. You have full
                control over these permissions and can revoke them at any time in your iPhone's Settings.</p>

            <h2>6. Verification & Open Source</h2>
            <p>Transparency is key to trust. Vital2AI is <a href="https://github.com/agalbourdin/vital2ai"
                    target="_blank" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: underline;">open-source software</a>.
                This means our code is publicly available for anyone to audit, ensuring that we handle your health data
                exactly as described in this policy. You can verify every line of code to see how your information is
                processed entirely on your device.</p>
